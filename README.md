# Top Down Pixel Art Rpg Survival Game
Is a game I am creating in scratch by myself, inspired by Minecraft, Zelda, Terraria, and a few others.
It is currently in the prototype stage and will be adding more features soon.
When it is finished, it can be played on my scratch account (same username) or on my itch.io
